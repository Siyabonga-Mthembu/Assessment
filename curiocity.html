          <div class="one-text">The image of my life extended as I stepped into adulthood.<br/><br/> 
            With it came a thoughtful sense of responsibility and the realization that lifeâ€™s palette is painted with choices.<br><br/> 
            I navigated through education, career, and personal relationships, each adding strokes to the evolving masterpiece. <br/><br/>
            The hues of success and failure merged, creating a spectrum that shaped my character and aspirations.</div>

          <div class="tittlename"> Matric Results Failed Me</div>
          <div class="two-text">After I matriculated I had to sit down and think what i should go for that can change my life, so i looked at the relationship between go study and go work.<br/>
          The first choice was to go for work to offer a support to my poor family and just because i didn't know where to and what to go for studying because my matric results points didn't match my expectations<br/><br/>
        When I was on my schooling journey I had a dream to become a doctor but that dream fades away during standard 9 class and my manchenical angineer dream fetched me.
    It was really hard form me to accept that my matric results failed me on these dream career and I was contenning looking for any ways that could take me to my dream career, but failed the whole year. </div>

          <div class="three-text"> Being rejected by my dream career was really tough and i felt real embarassed and it lowered my self-estem. One day i bought a cellphone Samsang D900 and there is when my curiocity about technology cultivated.<br/>
          The phone was amezing and it amde me wonder about people who developed it.This drained alot my my interest and I was ambicious of becoming one of them one day.
        <br/><br/> I did a research and found an IT learnership course in August 2014 after a 20 months of matriculated study. I applied for the course and fortunatly it was accepted, then my new journery started.</div>
