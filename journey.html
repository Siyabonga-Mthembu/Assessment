          <div class="one-text">My childhood was a masterpiece of exploration and wonder. <br/><br/>
            I can still brightly recall the laughter that echoed through the passages of my home, the smell of freshly baked cookies in the kitchen, and the warmth of family gatherings.<br/><br/>
             In that shell of familiarity, I discovered my greedy curiosity. <br/><br/>
             From chasing fireflies in the backyard to building fortresses out of blankets, every day was an adventure waiting to be explored.</div>

          <div class="two-text"> It is important to remember that life is a long journey and people have a different pace, so it's not a one-size-fits-all situation.<br/><br/>
          I guess my journey began with a little adventure in a small area called Emfekayi of Mtubatuba Township.
        I was born, grew up there and started my early education at Ntulufakazi Primary School on 2001, then moved to Emchakwini Primary to attend Standard3 to standard 5 classes.<br/>
      <br/> At that period of time we were a big family made up of Sisters,brother, male and female cousins, and our parents who were helping us with a patterns of directions and parthways which we systemetically call it a <emp>life journey </emp> today.

          <div class="tittlename"> Secondary Education</div>
          <div class="three-text"> At this stage my eyes were opened widely, I knew what Education is and where it inteand to take me through. however there were lot of challenges we faced as a family but with God's Grace i escaped<br/><br/>
          Ok, I began My Hight School classe at Masibonisane Secondary School by year:2008 to year 2012. <br/><br/> I was a student of Science and Mathematics, with an excellent educational performance and excellent marks but I was a teenager. Here comes my standard 11 class, the teenager stage became more powerfull than my well-being. I failed the second term for the first time of my education.<br/>
          The rest was God Grace even on my Grade12 class I wasn't a normal focused person as I was before.<br/>
