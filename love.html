          <div class="one-text">Love, a powerful and intricate emotion, is the melody that resonates through this tapestry.<br/><br/>
             It weaves through the fabric of our existence, painting life with hues of passion, kindness, and understanding. <br/><br/>
             It is the emotional anchor that provides solace in turbulent times and adds depth and vibrancy to our days.</div>

          <div class="tittlename"> Love From Family</div>
          <div class="two-text"> Love I'm recieving from my family is unique, increadible and infinite to define. 
          I always thanks God for the Gift of family, love and trust that we commit among one onather at home which always facilitate our growth, peace and happiness. It always gives us a reason to wakeup and hope for another day.<br/><br/>
        I really Love My Mom (Luisa) with all of my heart. She is the reason why I'm still breathing, you know I've been through alot in my life, I surfered from sickness, health problems, and even ones found myself sleeping in hospitals due to fragile injuries.
      She never gave up on me, she stand for her child in dark or blue. she fought for me when there was no one else around. I think beside God she's the best Angel I've ever seen.</div>

          <div class="tittlename">Love from Relationships</div>
          <div class="three-text"> This part of my story is very sad and irrelevant that I can share it under this beautiful topic but even sad stories are meant to be told with love because they happen for reasons<br/><br/>
          I've in many different Relationships , I loved and been Loved, I won and failed, I Rised and fell, but among all these relationships there is one that is hard for me to passaway out of my mind.<br/>
        One day I will put it on my bloggar and share alink here so that others can read it and understand it.
      <br/><br/> But i can put it to you that for now i'm not in a kind of any relationship and I'm also hard to trust women.</div>
