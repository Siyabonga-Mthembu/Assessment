          <div class="one-text">Yet, amid this journey, persistence emerges as the unwavering flame that sustains our effort.<br/><br/>
             It is the unyielding resolve that turns setbacks into opportunities and fuels our resilience.<br/><br/>
             Through persistence, we weather the storms, surpass obstacles, and continue to move forward, undeterred by the challenges that come our way.</div>

          <div class="tittlename"> Surfered After First Rejection</div>
          <div class="two-text"> My persistance accounts from alot of rejections, failure, setbacks, distortions that made me feel like I am moving with no direction<br/><br/>
            In August 2014 I set a goal, A goal that when I finish accomplishing my System support dream I will move straight to colledges chasing my dream in codding or else I will seek a well paiying job
            that will help me look after my family. Yes i conquired that 3 years in a learnership, unfortunately I couldn't find a proper job, i couldn't find colledge either up untill year 2019 then i got 
            a low paying job in a clothing factory in durban<br/> That job wasn,t easy and maybe wasn't made for me so i decided to leave in by Septermber 2020. and went to another one right there in Durban.

          <div class="tittlename"> Second Rejection</div>
          <div class="three-text">There was a time when my hope came alive again. That is when i recieved an Email from WeThinkCode Institution inviting me to come and do a two week selection bootcamp with them. <br/><br/>
          By that time I felt a little bit showers of hope running in my veins restoring amusements. I was working for KFC, I had to plan how am I going to convince my employer to let me go for this but it was hard to face him at that time. I spoke with one of my collegues and ask him to also step on my shift. I went there and there were 200 other students who came for the same bootcamp with me. 
          I was very frustrated but didnt give up.I was managed to finish my bootcamp unfortunately I didnt nake it to be one of their 30 succesful students.<br><br/>
        beside those failures i didn't look back i didn't surrender i cept on applying hard that's why today I found myself in NEMISA Institute.</div>
